		<h1 class="title">About</h1>
		<p class="center">	My name is José Bento, I edit videos, produce music and paint pixelart; I'm learning programming and, currently, game development. I'm only 17 and I want to keep improving on each of these skills while still learning new different things everyday. I like to listen to music / podcasts, read, write and play video games — when I have time to.</p>
		<p class="center">	I created this website to document my learning process and share my everyday thoughts and plans for the future, towards whoever is currently reading this.</p>
