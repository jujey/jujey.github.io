		<br>
		<p class="thought">Minimalism is simply not having too much materials, — or simply, not having too much, on a general basis — it's not only limited to this, I'm also talking about details, less details, more simplicity. For example, minimalism could very easily be the antonymous of <i>shopaholic</i> as well. If you still don't get it, take a look at this very website you're in, bland, simple, but still, rather appealing, right? This is — what I like to consider — an excellent example of minimalism and simplicity. But of course, this isn't what everyone wants, not that this is unhealthy or anything, — although there could be not so healthy examples of minimalism, only when taken to the extreme, which you shouldn't obviously do — but some people just don't get along with this concept. Are you one of those people / will you not be one of those people after reading this? I don't guarantee that, this <i>thought</i> is simply just to — somehow — educate you about the good sides of minimalism and why you should do it / try it — if you want to — .</p>
		<p class="thought">Now you're asking, why minimalism, what's the purpose? Minimalists can be very different from each other, and most of them have diverse reasons as to why they have decided to approach this new way of thinking / living. Minimalism can encourage you to focus more on important things. I'll take my website — again — as an example, I don't want fancy buttons, complex structure, images everywhere / ads, because I created this place to share my ideas and <i>thoughts</i>, and that's exactly what I'll focus on, without the unnecessary bloat and extras, which just distract you from your actual needs. This concept can also make you happier and reduce stress, because with minimalism comes better organization and clarity. In a way, it brings more meaning into your life, because you remove what doesn't have meaning and decide to stick with what has.</p>
		<p class="thought">This is my take on what minimalism is and why you should try it, I personally love minimalism and have been applying it to some things in my life. It has indeed been a positive change for me.</p>
