		<br>
		<p class="thought">You should stop molding your personality to whatever you see on the internet, I know it's hard, and it does take courage to really be yourself nowadays, but we all should give it a try. Immense quantities of users have reported that they feel less secure and confident about themselves after spending huge amounts of hours using social media. Some go as far as saying that this new habit has turned them into complete narcissists. It has changed the way they view things, their tastes changed, everything. But what makes this happen? Well, advertisements and celebrities are a big portion of this. Celebrities can influence thousands of people just by simply sharing their political views on the internet, for example. Ads influence you in buying new products from big companies, and before you even think about it, they immediately tell you why you should.</p>
		<p class="thought">Now, spending hours on social media is obviously unhealthy, but it also doesn't automatically make you a bad person nor a narcissist, it's how you use and treat it that makes you one. Go out more, talk to your friends IRL, exercise, read a book, all these things will improve you as a person. And no, I'm not telling you to completely stop using social media, if that's your jam, go for it, but keep everything I told you earlier in mind.</p>
