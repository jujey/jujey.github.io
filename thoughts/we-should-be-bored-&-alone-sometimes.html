		<p class="thought">We should be bored and alone sometimes, just for a minute, it's all it takes to make us and our lives a little better. Stop picking up your phone and scrolling through whatever insignificant platform or social media you tend to use whenever you're bored. Take a deep breath and think for a second about whatever you want, take advantage of those moments of vulnerability, allow you to improve and learn more about yourself through quiet introspection, without any type of distraction. Disconnect a little, from time to time, it will heal you and most certainly improve the way you see things.</p>
