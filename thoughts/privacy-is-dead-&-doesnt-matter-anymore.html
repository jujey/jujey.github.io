		<br>
		<p class="thought">You might think privacy matters, you're right if that's your belief and we do share the same opinion, but this thing we call privacy has mutated, mutated in a way that most of us didn't even notice it did, ever since the internet and various other types of communication devices and systems were created. All these people changing their routines and habits just so they can have their "privacy", but is this working for them? By "these people" I mean the guys that installed Linux, deleted social media, changed software, changed email, phone number, etc... They did this to feel secure — safe in a way — but why make those changes in your life, if you will end up creating a new email, having a new phone number, installing certain software, and so on... After quite a bit of time you're going to get back into your old routines, you're going to lose your so desired "privacy", again. No matter what we do, we will always need a Google email account, a phone number, a certain social media or software to communicate with our friends and family, or just something to boost our dopamine levels. We will always fall into the hands of the largest companies in the world (FAANG), whether you like it or not. I myself have tried to establish some sort of privacy of my own, since I already understood a lot about Linux I just kept using it but changed certain bits I was failing at, so I did the obvious and deleted social media, changed emails, etc... All I can say is that it was not possible nor worth it and I had to go back into my old ways, even if I didn't want to, I had to get back into social media and use certain software I stopped using for months, just to get back in touch with others. Society is stuck with this problem and will most likely be this way forever.</p>
		<p class="thought">If you're not aware of what FAANG and the type of privacy I'm constantly referring to are, you might want to continue reading this <i>thought</i>. FAANG refers to Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google; the biggest companies in the world, but what does this have to do with privacy? Well, these constantly use user's personal information to either store, sell to other companies or use to better recommend ads for them, some go as far as to record audio through their microphones to later recommend them ads about certain topics they talked about near their devices. This sounds scary and rather illegal, right? Almost like we're living in a dystopian world from some Hollywood movie. This is in fact scary, but not illegal, actually, most of these big companies tell all of us about these problems I just talked about earlier in their EULAS, but what do we do? We scroll all the way to the bottom and click accept, not even reading a single word. Now for the companies and organizations that don't even mention this in their EULAS, well, what's the difference? Yes, they will eventually get in big trouble, but even if they warn us about what they'll do with our information we will just not listen. This is legal, we procrastinate about our privacy, while in most cases it's completely our fault, but at the same time, it's not, we can't do anything about it and are somewhat obligated to use their products, and while we're at it, they're profiting from our information. What's worse is that, if it's not a company nor an organization, it's probably your government.</p>
		<p class="thought">Despite the title — that claims that privacy doesn't matter anymore (although this is partially true) — , privacy does matter and it will forever, what bothers me is that some people have entirely forgotten about it, and the ones that didn't — and are very aware of this problem — aren't doing anything to change it, and even if someone tries, or is trying to, they will not be able to make a big change all by themselves. The current state of the internet almost makes privacy impossible to obtain, it will not be at all easy, and the constant evolution of technology will make it harder every year, but it's up to us to change that. If you can't change it globally, it's fine, start small, change your habits and try as hard as you can to not go back.</p>
		<p class="thought">I will not get into the political side of all of this, although I should and it is probably one of the most important sides about this whole topic, but all I want is to scratch the surface and show you how big of a problem this is. I might continue and go more in-depth, but as for now I highly recommend you in checking out <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://larrysanger.org/2019/01/how-im-locking-down-my-cyber-life/">this</a> series and these two parts in it: <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://larrysanger.org/2019/01/why-does-information-privacy-matter-again/">1</a> and <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://larrysanger.org/2019/02/how-deep-should-one-go-into-this-privacy-stuff-anyway/">2</a>.</p>
